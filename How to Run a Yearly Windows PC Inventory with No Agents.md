# How to Run a Yearly Windows PC Inventory with No Agents (PowerShell → JSON → Offline HTML/CSV)

If you work in a small IT team or MSP, you probably know this feeling:

> “We *should* know what’s inside all these Windows PCs,
> but the last ‘full inventory’ is buried in a spreadsheet from two years ago.”

Most inventory solutions want you to:

- deploy agents everywhere, or
- spin up a server + database, or
- commit to a full-blown CMDB/RMM platform.

Sometimes that’s the right answer.  
But sometimes you just want a **clean, reliable snapshot once or twice a year** without changing your entire tooling.

This post is for that second case.

**TL;DR:** Run a free PowerShell collector on each Windows PC → gather JSON snapshots in one folder → generate **offline HTML reports + CSV inventories** in minutes.  
**No agents. No cloud. No installs.**

## The constraints (a realistic small-IT scenario)

This is the environment I had in mind:

- 50–300 Windows 10/11 PCs
- A small IT team or one-person MSP
- Maybe you already have AD / Intune / RMM / “something”
- But you still want a **human-readable snapshot** you can hand to management, auditors, or clients

Requirements:

- **No agents**: you don’t want to install and later clean up yet another agent
- **No central server**: you want to run from an admin PC + (optional) network share
- **Portable outputs**: HTML for humans, CSV for Excel/BI/tools
- **Run it once (or a few times a year)** and you’re done

If that sounds like your life, keep reading.

## Step 1 — Collect data with a simple PowerShell script

First, you need a way to ask each PC:

> “Who are you? What hardware do you have? What software is installed?”

You can do this with a single PowerShell script that:

- queries WMI / registry / basic system info
- writes everything into a **single JSON file per PC**
- saves it to a folder (local or a network share)

A typical run looks like this:

```powershell
.\ZeroAgent-Collector.ps1 `
  -OutputPath "\\YOURSERVER\PC_Inventory\%COMPUTERNAME%.json"

  After you’ve run this on all target PCs, you end up with:

  \\YOURSERVER\PC_Inventory\
  PC-001.json
  PC-002.json
  PC-003.json
  ...

  ```

Each file is a structured snapshot of that PC.

You can roll this out however you like:

- manually (ask users to run it)
- logon script
- your existing software deployment tool
- RMM script

The important part is: **no resident agent**. The script runs, dumps JSON, and exits.

---

## Step 2 — Store everything in one place

This part is boring but important:

- Pick one share (or folder) where all JSON files live
- Make sure your admin PC can read it
- Treat that folder as your **raw inventory data lake**

That folder becomes your source of truth. As long as you keep it, you can regenerate reports as many times as you want.

## Step 3 — Turn JSON into offline HTML reports and CSV inventories

Raw JSON is great for machines, not for humans.

For reporting and audits, you usually need:

- A PC list you can sort/filter in Excel (`computers.csv`)
- Per-site or per-department breakdowns
- “Which PCs are low on RAM / disk?”
- “Which OS / Office versions do we have and where?”
- A human-readable HTML report you can show to non-IT people

This is where I use **Zero Agent Viewer** — a small portable `.exe` designed specifically for this workflow.

> Note: This is **not** an RMM/CMDB. It’s a **run-once inventory + report generator**.

The flow looks like this:

1) Point the Viewer at the folder with all your JSON files  
2) (Optional) define your own groupings in a simple `pc_groups.csv`, like:
   - `SiteA,PC-001`
   - `SiteB,PC-050`
   - etc.
3) Click **Generate Reports**

You get:

- A grouped offline HTML report with:
  - grouped PCs (by site/department/whatever you defined)
  - drill-down into each machine
  - quick filters and summaries
- CSV exports:
  - `computers.csv` — one row per PC
  - plus other summary tables ready for Excel / Power BI / internal tooling

If you want to see what the HTML output looks like before touching your own data, here’s a live sample report with dummy data:

👉 https://zeroagent-labs.github.io/za-sample-report/

It’s static HTML + JS — open it in any browser, email it, archive it with your audit docs, etc.

## Why this works well as a “yearly snapshot” workflow

This isn’t trying to replace your RMM or a full CMDB. Instead, it’s optimized for:

- Yearly (or quarterly) inventory audits
- New client onboarding
- Pre-migration assessments
- “We haven’t had a proper inventory in years, let’s fix that” projects

Pros:

- No agents to deploy/remove
- No central server to maintain
- All data stays in your environment (local/network share)
- Outputs are boring but useful (offline HTML/CSV deliverables)

Because the Viewer is a single `.exe`, you can:

- keep it in your admin toolbox
- reuse it for future inventories without rebuilding anything
- generate deliverables consistently every time

---

## If you want to try this workflow as-is

There are many ways to DIY:

- Write your own PowerShell collector
- Aggregate JSON with scripts
- Hack together your own HTML/CSV exports

If you enjoy that — honestly, go for it. I did that for a while.

If you’d rather skip the glue code and run the full flow, I packaged my setup as:

**Zero Agent Viewer — Agentless Windows PC Inventory & Audit Reports**  
https://www.zeroagentlabs.com/

It includes:

- the pre-compiled Viewer `.exe`
- the free Collector script
- config files (grouping etc.)
- a short user guide
- and a 30-day money-back guarantee

So you can test it in a real environment without committing long-term.

## Quick questions (I’d love your feedback)

If you do annual inventories or audit deliverables, I’m curious:

1) What’s your biggest pain point with yearly inventory?  
2) Do you need **software inventory** as much as hardware, or vice versa?  
3) Would an “audit pack” deliverable (offline HTML + CSV) be useful in your workflow?

Either way, I hope this post gives you a clean mental model for:

> “Once a year, collect everything, generate HTML + CSV, archive the evidence, and be done.”
